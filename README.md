Overview
This repository contains a foundational framework for a sentiment analysis system designed for trading strategies. It demonstrates how to preprocess textual data, perform sentiment analysis, integrate with market data, and generate basic trading signals. This framework serves as a starting point and is intended to be customized and extended based on individual trading strategies and data availability.

Description
The framework consists of several key components:

Text Preprocessing
The text preprocessing component cleans and normalizes textual data, which is essential for effective sentiment analysis. It includes lowercasing, removing URLs, mentions, hashtags, special characters, tokenization, removing stopwords, and lemmatization.

Sentiment Analysis
A mock function simulates continuous sentiment scoring, a crucial aspect in understanding market sentiment. In a practical implementation, this function would be replaced with an advanced NLP model capable of analyzing financial texts and outputting a nuanced sentiment score.

Market Data Integration
The framework demonstrates how to integrate sentiment data with market data. It includes a placeholder function to fetch market data, which in a real-world scenario, would involve live data feeds.

Trading Signal Generation
The trading signal logic in this framework is based on the sentiment scores and is designed to be simplistic. This logic can be expanded to include more complex algorithms, historical data analysis, and other market indicators.

Customization and Extension
This framework is intended as a base to jump off of and can be customized and expanded in several ways:

Enhanced Text Preprocessing: Depending on the data source, additional preprocessing steps may be necessary.
Real Sentiment Analysis Model: Integrating a machine learning model trained on financial texts for accurate sentiment scoring.
Live Data Feeds: Connecting to real-time APIs for market and textual data.
Complex Trading Logic: Developing sophisticated trading algorithms based on a combination of sentiment data, historical market data, and other relevant indicators.
Disclaimer
This framework is for educational and demonstrational purposes. It is not intended for use in live trading without significant modifications and thorough testing. Users should conduct their own due diligence and consider consulting with a financial expert before implementing any trading strategies.
